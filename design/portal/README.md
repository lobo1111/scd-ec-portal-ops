# Portal design template

Generic HTML/CSS mockups for a portal: login, logout, home (web + mobile), and ops management screens.

- **home-web.html**, **home-mobile.html** – Dashboard placeholder.
- **admin-companies.html** – Manage admin companies: list (legal name, contact email, community/admin-user counts), search, add company, edit company modal. Use as reference for implementing the Admin companies feature in the app.
- **login.html**, **logout.html** – Auth flows.

**Customize for your project:** replace "Portal" in titles and headers with your app or portal name. Replace the avatar initial in the header if desired. Swap `../assets/echocorner.png` and `echocorner_mini.png` for your own logo assets.
